# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSORS
 
 
 This Telegram Bot is created to interact and play rock paper scissors with USER
 
 1).First using the program Data_capture.py i've collected data to train the model. This program will ask the user to his name and captures the data given by him through the camera and store them. Later Image processsing is done to the data and stored them as skeletons and resize it to (32,32) for easy and consistent training.
 
 2).Later this data is used to train machine learning model.A Pipe line of Classifiers are used to train and test the data. A classifier with highest accuracy is choosen as Final model, which is to be savedÂ´and later used by the Bot.
 
3).Later a Bot is created which takes the input from User, Recognises it and reply with a Random gesture of its own, It looks as Follows

4). During the image processing above images are converted into skeletons in the size of 32,32 in order to wvwn work with small models
